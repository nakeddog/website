          <p>
            The Naked Dog combines training, exercise and socialization to create a healthy, balanced dog.
            I offer off-leash hiking, in-home boarding and holistic training that makes your dog the best pet he or she can be!

          <h3>Hiking</h3>
          <p>For the daily off-leash hiking service, I pick the dog up at your home, take them on a 1.5-2 hour hike, then drop them off at home, happy and tired.</p>
          <h3>Boarding</h3>
          <p>
            For boarding, I offer board and train or regular boarding in my home with a limited number of dogs at a time. The dogs get training brush-ups, daily hiking adventures and all the care, love and attention they are used to at home!

          <h1>About The Naked Dog</h1>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Established in 2013. A lifelong love of animals and
            several years of dog training led me to open The Naked
            Dog. As a long time practitioner of Natural Horsemanship,
            I sought to connect with dogs in a way that didn't involve
            treats or gimmicks, but instead worked with their innate
            psychology to produce the desired result. I firmly
            believe that regular exercise, strong leadership and
            proper nutrition are the key factors to having a long and
            happy relationship with your dog. This is a dream job
            for me and I am ecstatic to be getting such positive
            reviews from my clients!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            What sets The Naked Dog apart from other training programs
            is the real-world training on the trails that's
            consistently reinforced every time your dog joins us for a
            hike. In addition to the structure of working with a
            trainer, the hikes provide daily exercise and
            socialization; dogs learn quickly from the good example
            set by the well-trained dogs in the group.

            <blockquote>
              <p>Through the process of spending time with Allegra and her pack, our puppy has acquired great-off leash skills so that we now feel confident taking her on hikes ourselves.</p>
              <footer>Audrey C. </footer>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Allegra has cared for both of our Weimers and always went above and beyond. She gets to know your pet, finds where they need improvement/growth, and works with them to make sure they are 10X better the day you pick them up from the day you dropped them off. Consistently reporting on how they are doing on a daily basis (if you wish), sending tons of pictures, and keeps you posted on any concerns. She makes our pups feel like they are home. In fact, our dogs come home missing Allegra and can't wait to see her again.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <p>She took her time. Gave great advice on everything a new puppy owner could want to know - housebreaking, feeding, getting them to listen, stop biting & jumping, how to walk on leash, socialize with bigger dogs in a healthy way, learning the psychology of dogs and what they need to feel secure & know that I'm their leader, fun tricks for pups, and much more. And she didn't leave until all my questions were answered and I felt comfortable.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Hands down the best thing you could do for your dog and your own peace of mind. The Naked Dog is a thousand times better than any other day care or training/boarding service. Not only are the dogs stimulated by exploring new environments and smells but they are experiencing everything as a part of a pack.</p>
              <footer>Lori W.</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Allegra's dedication and care for each dog, the competitive pricing, and the frame-worthy photos that I look forward to getting every day makes The Naked Dog deserve so many more than 5 stars.</p>
